# Homelights - Easy automation for 1515 Alice

This is a small daemon running on my home network that tries to automate some
aspect of my world. In this case, it pings my phone's DNS to see if I'm on the
network. If so, I'm considered "Home". If I'm home and its between 8a and 9a in
the work week, it is considered time for me to leave for work so the light in my
apartment entrance turns on to help me get ready.

If I go away, my entrance light turns off.

If I come home from being away, my entrance light turns on to give me some
visibility when I come in.
